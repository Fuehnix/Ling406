that we focus on enjoying the moment and that's the best way to do so . \\n\"\n 'hey , just like the video game ! \\n'\n 'and it\\'s everything \" caligula \" might have been but , alas , wasn\\'t . \\n'\n \"hopefully , this film didn't influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time . \\n\"\n ' \" the siege \" is constantly heavy-handed , not entertaining or insightful , and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay . \\n'\n 'yup those pretty much describe \" end of days \" . \\n'\n \"loser may be a crashing bore , but gee , aren't those two kids swell ? \\n\"\n ' \" a bug\\'s life , \" goes down as yet another failure for disney , and it is a sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture , \" i\\'ll be home for christmas . \" \\n'\n 'as for me , i\\'m going to watch \" a fish called wanda \" now and try to forget i ever saw \" heartbreakers . \" \\n'\n 'watching the film clean and sober , you are bound to recognize how truly awful it is . \\n'\n '[r] \\n' \"you'll see 60% of anastasia there . \\n\"\n \"skip this dull film , unless you want to see woods , or make fun of steiger's accent , or see stone's breasts again . \\n\"\n 'saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions . \\n'\n \"grade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you're looking for inadvertent yuks . \\n\"\n \"it's a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended , because

and james belushi . \\n\"\n 'regardless , if he continues on this career track , could a tv series be far behind ? \\n'\n \"i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie . \\n\"\n \"if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk - now that's funny . \\n\"\n \"thumbs up to fichtner then , and thumbs down--way , way , down--to everyone else involved in this sorry mess , a movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesn't even warrant

it is , all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can't help marlon wayans get this one off the ground . \\n\"\n 'fox fails yet again in his search for intelligent life . \\n'\n \"there's no zest in any aspect of the film , and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it . \\n\"\n 'the stalking killer with crazy motivation has become a tired clich ? , as everyone seems to have forgotten : real horror is not about what is seen but about what is unknown . \\n'\n \"a lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that's * what i call empowerment . \\n\"\n \"if they'd done that much , at least i would have been entertained . \\n\"\n 'i would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n'\n \"great films

family outing , but they sure don't make ? em like they used to . \\n\"\n 'and spawn unapologetically targets children . \\n'\n 'the \" doctors are not gods \" theme will resonate with a number of people , but it\\'s so poorly produced that no one will care . \\n'\n 'avoid this clunker . \\n'\n 'just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage , and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world , is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in , \" porky\\'s . \" \\n'\n 'come on ! \" , but when it comes down to it , i think that\\'s the point . \\n'\n 'it goes without saying that \" desperate measures \" needs an operation of its very own . \\n'\n \"no ben , you're the complete opposite . \\n\"\n \"picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes , and expecting us to like aniston's character , who comes off as a cold , spoiled bitch . \\n\"\n 'this , combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying . \\n'\n 'on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" the watcher \" is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 . the real torture is watching it . \\n'\n 'indeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid . \\n'\n 'more yelling than humor . \\n'\n \"and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn't out of the question . \\n\"\n \"overall , then , you'd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided ( perhaps a plague ) \\n\"\n 'rent the cartoon ! \\n'\n 'it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers . \\n'\n 'while he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer , the end result is no net gain . \\n'\n \"they'll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose . \\n\"\n 'and hopefully , other horror films , such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house , will not be as bad as this one . \\n'\n 'perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours . \\n'\n ' . \\n'\n \"this was supposed to be the movie that didn't offend anyone , but it's offensive because it's terrible . \\n\"\n \"if other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as _urban_legend_ , the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers' many victims . \\n\"\n 'there are no redeeming factors in \" knock off \" and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased . \\n'\n \"somehow , quality can't overshadow quantity . \\n\"\n 'that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time . \\n'\n '[pg-13] \\n'\n 'while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels . \\n'\n 'i asked myself the same question , having spent 99 cents renting this turkey . \\n'\n 'if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself . \\n'\n 'director griffin dunne is known mainly as an actor in such films as an american werewolf in london and after hours . \\n'\n 'mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film . \\n'\n \"but it's just a really crap film , and an example of an ill-advised distribution of a foreign film . \\n\"\n 'stick to \" tommy boy \" , and we\\'ll all be \" friends \" . \\n'\n 'and , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . \\n'\n \"there's a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters , and the film features passable performances from sandler , joey lauren adams ( as the love interest ) , and the two young boys , but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny . \\n\"\n 'there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not . \\n'\n 'black buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits , which is more that we can say for lazard . . \\n'\n 'the only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond . \\n'\n \"and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life . \\n\"\n '[pg-13] \\n'\n 'the bottom line : just like a slasher movie , this ? 80s comedy is just one too many . \\n'\n 'and that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying . \\n'\n \"i'd tell him to quit while he's ahead , but in these last two years , he's ultimately already buried himself . \\n\"\n 'it is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers . \\n'\n \"it's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful . \\n\"\n 'the result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n'\n 'but , on the other hand , it is clueless . \\n'\n \"beautiful ( 1/10 ) - my best friend's wedding ( 7/10 ) - notting hill ( 5/10 ) - pretty woman ( 7/10 ) -runaway bride ( 5/10 ) - someone like you ( 4/10 )

watched his previous work brazil , but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out , you wish it were more complex , and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me . \\n\"\n \"a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact . \\n\"\n 'pm is one long headache . \\n'\n \"don't be seduced into watching this movie unless you've got several loads of laundry and nothing else to

. \\n'\n \"now there's a low blow for you . \\n\"\n 'an awful movie on all counts , my suggestion is to bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent , rude vampire slayers . \\n'\n \"it's not saying much , considering martin's lackluster character , but hartman leaves him in the dust . \\n\"\n \"unfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film's shortcomings , and weren't enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater . \\n\"\n 'while certainly better than 1978\\'s \" king kong lives \" ( itself a lousy sequel to a not particularly good remake ) , \" mighty joe young \" proves how the mighty keep falling . \\n'\n 'while \" town and country \" isn\\'t exactly painful to sit through , it mostly just lays there . \\n'\n \"a time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time . \\n\"\n 'so , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends . \\n'\n \"and i can't wait for it to premier on mst3k . \\n\"\n 'the horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it . \\n'\n 'rent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only . \\n'\n \"i just hope they don't make a sequel ! \\n\" '[pg] \\n'\n 'then , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the \" event \" mentality and make a movie instead of a

experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak . \\n'\n \"crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `my giant' left me feeling like i'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon . \\n\"\n 'my ( extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock ) \\n'\n 'although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy . \\n'\n 'director jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie and this one back-to-back and see if he realises where he went wrong . \\n'\n 'this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . \\n'\n 'a nightmare of

\"let's just hope one never arrives . \\n\"\n \"this one's short on batteries . \\n\"\n 'with rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \\n'\n ' : ) \\n'\n 'dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end , but at what a price . \\n'\n \"i suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing , but they sure don't make ? em like they used to . \\n\"\n 'and spawn unapologetically targets children . \\n'\n 'the \" doctors are not gods \" theme will resonate with a number of people , but it\\'s so poorly produced that no one will care . \\n'\n 'avoid this clunker . \\n'\n 'just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage , and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world , is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in , \" porky\\'s . \" \\n'\n 'come on ! \" , but when it comes down to it , i think that\\'s the point . \\n'\n 'it goes without saying that \" desperate measures \" needs an operation of its very own . \\n'\n \"no ben , you're the complete opposite . \\n\"\n \"picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes , and expecting us to like aniston's character , who comes off as a cold , spoiled bitch . \\n\"\n 'this , combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying . \\n'\n 'on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" the watcher \" is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 . the real torture is watching it . \\n'\n 'indeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid . \\n'\n 'more yelling than humor . \\n'\n \"and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn't out of the question . \\n\"\n \"overall , then , you'd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided ( perhaps a plague ) \\n\"\n 'rent the cartoon ! \\n'\n 'it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers . \\n'\n 'while he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer , the end result is no net gain . \\n'\n \"they'll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose . \\n\"\n 'and hopefully , other horror films , such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house , will not be as bad as this one . \\n'\n 'perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours . \\n'\n ' . \\n'\n \"this was supposed to be the movie that didn't offend anyone , but it's offensive because it's terrible . \\n\"\n \"if other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as _urban_legend_ , the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers' many victims . \\n\"\n 'there are no redeeming factors in \" knock off \" and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased . \\n'\n \"somehow , quality can't overshadow quantity . \\n\"\n 'that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time . \\n'\n '[pg-13] \\n'\n 'while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels . \\n'\n 'i asked myself the same question , having spent 99 cents renting this turkey . \\n'\n 'if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself . \\n'\n 'director griffin dunne is known mainly as an actor in such films as an american werewolf in london and after hours . \\n'\n 'mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film . \\n'\n \"but it's just a really crap film , and an example of an ill-advised distribution of a foreign film . \\n\"\n 'stick to \" tommy boy \" , and we\\'ll all be \" friends \" . \\n'\n 'and , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . \\n'\n \"there's a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters , and the film features passable performances from sandler , joey lauren adams ( as the love interest ) , and the two young boys , but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny . \\n\"\n 'there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not . \\n'\n 'black buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits , which is more that we can say for lazard . . \\n'\n 'the only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond . \\n'\n \"and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life . \\n\"\n '[pg-13] \\n'\n 'the bottom line : just like a slasher movie , this ? 80s comedy is just one too many . \\n'\n 'and that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying . \\n'\n \"i'd tell him to quit while he's ahead , but in these last two years , he's ultimately already buried himself . \\n\"\n 'it is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers . \\n'\n \"it's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful . \\n\"\n 'the result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n'\n 'but , on the other hand , it is clueless . \\n'\n \"beautiful ( 1/10 ) - my best friend's wedding ( 7/10 ) - notting hill ( 5/10 ) - pretty woman ( 7/10 ) -runaway bride ( 5/10 ) - someone like you ( 4/10 ) - wedding planner ( 3/10 ) - when harry met sally ( 10/10 ) - you've got mail ( 4/10 ) \\n\"\n 'other than that , wait until it goes into heavy-rotation on cable . \\n'\n 'from that opening scene , where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz , to the conclusion which i don\\'t remember because i had practically fallen asleep ; cruel intentions is truly \" hell on earth , \" right up there with war and tax audits . \\n'\n '&#137 ; \\n' \"no , it's just horribly confused . \\n\"\n \"terry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate , and i haven't watched his previous work brazil , but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out , you wish it were more complex , and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me . \\n\"\n \"a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact . \\n\"\n 'pm is one long headache . \\n'\n \"don't be seduced into watching this movie unless you've got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch . \\n\"\n 'however , it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that , making the film a big disappointment . \\n'\n \"only it's not funny ! \\n\" 'the replacements offers none of this . \\n'\n \"now there's a low blow for you . \\n\"\n 'an awful movie on all counts , my suggestion is to bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent , rude vampire slayers . \\n'\n \"it's not saying much , considering martin's lackluster character , but hartman leaves him in the dust . \\n\"\n \"unfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film's shortcomings , and weren't enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater . \\n\"\n 'while certainly better than 1978\\'s \" king kong lives \" ( itself a lousy sequel to a not particularly good remake ) , \" mighty joe young \" proves how the mighty keep falling . \\n'\n 'while \" town and country \" isn\\'t exactly painful to sit through , it mostly just lays there . \\n'\n \"a time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time . \\n\"\n 'so , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends . \\n'\n \"and i can't wait for it to premier on mst3k . \\n\"\n 'the horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it . \\n'\n 'rent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only . \\n'\n \"i just hope they don't make a sequel ! \\n\" '[pg] \\n'\n 'then , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the \" event \" mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time . \\n'\n \"i just can't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself . \\n\"\n 'in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak . \\n'\n \"crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `my giant' left me feeling like i'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon . \\n\"\n 'my ( extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock ) \\n'\n 'although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy . \\n'\n 'director jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie and this one back-to-back and see if he realises where he went wrong . \\n'\n 'this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . \\n'\n 'a nightmare of elm street 3 ( 7/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the crow ( 9/10 ) - the crow : salvation ( 4/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - memento ( 10/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - stir of echoes ( 8/10 ) \\n'\n 'this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity . \\n'\n \"either way , it's probably in your best interests to skip the haunting . \\n\"\n 'strike now while the iron is cold . \\n'\n 'it is rated r for profanity , sex and one dope smoking scene and would be acceptable for older teenagers . \\n'\n 'what that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly out of luck . \\n'\n 'stars . \\n'\n 'i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n'\n
