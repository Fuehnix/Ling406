##Assignment #1: Temporal Named Entity Recognition

##How to use:
To use this program, load it as a jupyter notebook. There are 2 variables at the top of the code for the inputFileName and the outputFileName. Change these as you please, and the code will search for them in the local directory. You can see that it worked by it being printed out upon running the code block.  From there, simply run the rest of the code, and everything will be handled for you.  The dates that have been found will be output to the described output text file.  It should be noted that you must create the output text file yourself, as the program will be expecting you to have one in your directory.

##What the solution should look like
The objective is to extract all the fixed dates and federal holidays from a text file. Then each found date will be displayed on an individual line in the output file.
