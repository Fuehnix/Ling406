This code is a sentiment analysis classifier for movie reviews. It uses a unigram model with non-alphabetical filtering, stopword removal, stemming, POS tagging, and negation for the baseline, and the scikitlearn classifiers, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. To run the program, open a jupyter notebook and run the classifier.ipynb.  Due to the hard coded file structure, it is essential that all files are contained within a folder called TermProject, and that the there is a subfolder for txt_sentoken within TermProject, and that within txt_sentoken, there are pos and negative folders for the training data. To run different types of trials, simply add or remove comments, and adjust the global variables in the final main method.
