This code is a sentiment analysis classifier for movie reviews. It uses a bigram model with laplace smoothing, stop words, priors, stemming, and lowercase tokenization. To run the program, open a jupyter notebook and run the classifier.ipynb.  Due to the hard coded file structure, it is essential that all files are contained within a folder called TermProject, and that the there is a subfolder for txt_sentoken within TermProject, and that within txt_sentoken, there are pos and negative folders for the training data.
