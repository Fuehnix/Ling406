This code is a sentiment analysis classifier for movie reviews. It uses a unigram model and bag of words as the baseline, with scikitlearn classifiers Logarithmic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Tree models for comparison. In testing the effectiveness of textual features the following are implemented and tested: addone smoothing, stop words, priors, stemming, part of speech tagging, negation, and nonalphabetical filtering during tokenization . To run the program, open a jupyter notebook and run the classifier.ipynb.  Due to the hard coded file structure, it is essential that all files are contained within a folder called TermProject, and that the there is a subfolder for txt_sentoken within TermProject, and that within txt_sentoken, there are pos and negative folders for the training data. The alternative is to change a couple of lines of code in the jupyter notebook so that it points to the correct directory.  Also note, due to the file limits of email, you will need to download the movie review corpus files yourself, as I was unable to send them in the zip.
