low , but there isn't anything much worse than an unfunny comedy . \\n\"\n \"all in all , compared with some of the hollywood's examples of political correctness , this film isn't so bad , but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better . \\n\"\n 'i felt no such earnestness . \\n' 'okay ? \\n'\n 'just too bad it has a bad script and is all together a bad movie . \\n'\n 'i asked myself the same question , having spent 99 cents renting this turkey . \\n'\n \"while watching `mission to mars' , my suggestion would be to immediately abort , or better yet , don't even strap yourself in for lift-off . \\n\"\n ' ( special note for trekkies : marina sirtis , the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek : the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife ) . \\n'\n \"it could only be commended for how appealing the film looks , as if it's a scrapbook of still photos put together to celebrate a mugging . \\n\"\n \"as it is , all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can't help marlon wayans get this one off the ground . \\n\"\n 'if anything , \" lara croft : tomb raider \" makes you want to check out the video game

norville barnes \\n'\n 'in sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off . \\n'\n \"the most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson's shorts and sent it sailing . \\n\"\n 'but in a movie theatre , everyone can hear you snore . \\n'\n 'this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been

they keep a straight face ? \\n'\n 'for all the money they could have done better . \\n'\n \"but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one , and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck . \\n\"\n 'it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers . \\n'\n 'if you really want to see a good version of \" the art of war \" , rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind \" rising sun \" , it isn\\'t a great film either , but at least it\\'s better than this . \\n'\n \"on screen , it's still paper thin . \\n\"\n 'simply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining . \\n'\n ' \" varsity blues , \" no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts . \\n'\n 'nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla . \\n'\n 'avoid . \\n'\n \"i can't think of a more appropriate

astonishing piece of cinematic damage . \\n\"\n 'the characters were as empty as the story , and the film was an easy one to forget . \\n'\n 'and a very distant back seat , at that . \\n' ' ( opens february 27 ) \\n'\n 'to extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? \\n'\n ' \" the book of shadows \" is a triumph of tedium over

another barely passable summer action flick . \\n'\n 'it should have read , \" memo to screenwriters : use you brain ! \" \\n'\n 'just a selection of crude jokes and repititive double-entendres . \\n'\n 'if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences , then shoot me now . \\n'\n \"friday the 13th is the sort of movie that is fun to sit down and

not sets or effects that make a movie , its the characters ; and quite frankly , these characters are no good . \\n\"\n \"bottom line : if you are compelled to see this movie , watch it on video so you can fast-forward to scenes with carroll o'connor and james belushi . \\n\"\n ' ( special note to x-philes : mith pilleggi , the actor who plays ad skinner in the x- files , could be seen in a

you thinking ? \\n'\n 'alcohol , lots of it , may have helped the viewing experience . \\n'\n 'what that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly
